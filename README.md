This project involves the design and implementation of a database system for managing university operations using Oracle Database and PL/SQL. 
The database tracks essential university data, including students, courses, exams, grades, and student groups. It features multiple views to 
analyze student performance, course pass rates, and exam attempts, along with ensuring data integrity through constraints and relational keys.

The project includes:

- SQL scripts to create tables, relationships, views and for populating.
- Views for tracking student rankings, group performance, grades, failed exams etc.

The system is designed to support administrative functions and provide insightful reports for student performance and course management.
